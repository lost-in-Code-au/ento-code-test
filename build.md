** Reece's component build
So to start with I read over the instructions and disected what was expected of the "ticket", after reading over it twice I felt there was some clarity required on a couple of notes just to make sure there wasn't any miss-inturutation and so orgainzed a catchup 15min talk with my supervisor.

While waiting on a planned meeting with my supervior I started to setup the enviorment to display the component, steps are below:

1. reseach possible stubs for emulation or any supporting libraries 
2. update Brew and NPM
3. decided on a clean create-react-app build to just display the component with sudo data

4. installed node-sass so I could use varitables and nested classnames in my css
5. converted css file to scss
6. installed react-modal, react-redux, mocha
